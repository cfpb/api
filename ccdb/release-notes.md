            This release expands the database to include consumer complaint narratives and company public responses dating back to March 19, 2015.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Consumers' descriptions of what happened are included if consumers consent to publishing the description and after we take steps to remove personal information.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Companies' public-facing responses to complaints are included if companies choose to publish one. Companies may select a public response from a set list of options as soon as they respond to the complaint, but no later than 180 days after the complaint was sent to the company for response.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For complaints where consumers consent to publishing the description of what happened, only the first 3 digits of the consumer-reported ZIP codes are displayed.

            This release reflects changes to the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/">consumer complaint form</a>.
        <ul>
          <li>The issues consumers can select on the student loan complaint form were revised. “Repaying your loan” and “Problems when you are unable to pay” were removed and “Can’t pay my loan” and “Dealing with my lender or servicer” were added.</li>
          <li>Consumers can now select a sub-issue for student loan complaints.</li>
          <li>Consumers can now submit a credit reporting complaint about the issues “Incorrect information on my credit report” and “Credit reporting company’s investigation” without first filing a dispute with the credit reporting company.</li>
        </ul> 
        Complaints we receive beginning December 18, 2013, will reflect these changes as they appear in the database. Complaints received before then will remain unchanged.
