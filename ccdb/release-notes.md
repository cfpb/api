                <p>This release enhances the searching and filtering capabilities within the Consumer Complaint Database. For instance, users can filter by more than one value within each filter type, view complaint counts for the values in each filter type, and see the number of matching search results. Search capabilities allow users to find specific words or phrases in a complaint, refine a search to display matches within only the company name or narrative text, and use advanced search functions to further refine search results. The API also supports the new capabilities.</p>

                <h4>Users can still</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Filter and search on all database fields, except for ‘Consumer disputed?’</li>
                    <li>Export search results from the database via CSV and JSON formats only</li>
                    <li>“Toggle” back to the original Socrata interface</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What Changed?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some filter labels were updated to be in better compliance with plain language standards. For instance, the “Submitted via” filter is now phrased “How did the consumer submit the complaint to the CFPB?” This does not affect how the data is labeled in the API or export.</li>
                    <li>Users can click on a complaint ID number to see all the details associated with that complaint in a detail page that has a unique, shareable URL.</li>
                    <li>“Consumer disputed?” is no longer a column that can be filtered; however, users will see the data in their search results and export files. The Bureau discontinued the consumer dispute option on April 24, 2017.</li>
                    <li>“Complaint ID” is no longer a column that can be filtered; however, users can search for specific complaint IDs.</li>
                </ul>

                    This release reflects updates made on April 24, 2017 to the form consumers use to submit complaints, including reorganizing how products, sub-products, issues, and sub-issues are grouped and making some plain language improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Consumer Complaint Database shows the consumer’s original product, sub-product, issue, and sub-issue selections consistent with the options available on the form at the time the consumer submitted the complaint.

                <p>
                    This release also includes formatting updates of company names, reflects the discontinuation of the consumer dispute process, and displays U.S. territories in the State field.

                <ul>
                  <li>The issues consumers can select on the student loan complaint form were revised. “Repaying your loan” and “Problems when you are unable to pay” were removed and “Can’t pay my loan” and “Dealing with my lender or servicer” were added.</li>
                  <li>Consumers can now select a sub-issue for student loan complaints.</li>
                  <li>Consumers can now submit a credit reporting complaint about the issues “Incorrect information on my credit report” and “Credit reporting company’s investigation” without first filing a dispute with the credit reporting company.</li>
                </ul>
                Complaints we receive beginning December 18, 2013, will reflect these changes as they appear in the database. Complaints received before then will remain unchanged.
