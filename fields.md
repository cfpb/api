## Field reference

Why so many rows and fields? Don't be alarmed–there's a lot of information in HMDA, but you can make your queries as basic or as detailed as you want. 

Use this page as a cheat sheet when you are ready to add color to some [basic queries](http://github.cfpb.io/api/hmda/basics). You can also skim this table to get an idea of the kinds of information you can find in HMDA records. If you are new to HMDA data, or need to understand the ins and outs of the information itself, visit our [HMDA site](http://consumerfinance.gov/hmda) to learn more.
