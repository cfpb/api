### API calls

Explore the API here using our interactive console. Need a little help? Read our [API basics]() to learn about [datasets](), [slices](), and [concepts](). 

##### Basic example

>**data:** Operations about datasets console goes here

##### Using HMDA data

> **hmda** console goes here

Ready to dive deeper? Look up all functions, and enumerations in our [Query language]() or 
learn about the variables found in HMDA data at [Field reference](). 

Think you can make the API better or just want to look under the hood? Check out [Qu](http://cfpg.github.io/qu), the software our data platform is based upon, and learn about how you can host your own datasets or contribute to the project.
